# Joy 👧👦

## Principles

- It's targeted for bundling small games/interactions within apps —see a cool gamified wizard or interactive pictures within e-books
- It's not intended for big games —you have things like Unity for games or Wave Engine for more industrial needs, for instance
- It values first the educational side than performance one

## "Backlog"

- [ ] Flappy Bird —just in-game: no menu, no counters
- [ ] Spritesheet support
- [ ] Adapt async/await state support back
- [ ] Sound support —through Montemagno?'s plug-in
